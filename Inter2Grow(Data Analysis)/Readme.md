# Sales Data Analysis

An assessment prepared by Intern2Grow, for its Data Analyst Virtual Internship Program.

## Assessment Overview

For this assessment, you will be given a small dataset and a set of questions to answer using that data. You will be expected to use your data analysis skills to answer the questions and present your findings in a clear and concise manner.

Don't forget to clean the data provided in the CSV file.
